    "## Part I: Introduction to Entanglement Purification and the BBPSSW Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **entanglement purification** was introduced by C. H. Bennett *et al.* [1]. Following the names of the authors, the original protocol is also called the **BBPSSW protocol**. The basic idea of entanglement purification is to create an (almost) maximally entangled Bell state by distilling entanglement from a larger number of qubit pairs that are not maximally entangled. For this reason, this concept is also referred to as **entanglement distillation**. Purification usually has to be performed by two remote parties, so only local operations, measurements and classical two-way communication are allowed for entanglement purification protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many applications of quantum information processing, such as quantum teleportation [2] or entanglement-based quantum cryptography [3], use the maximally entangled *Bell states* $\\{|\\Phi^{\\pm}\\rangle, |\\Psi^{\\pm}\\rangle\\}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\Phi^{\\pm}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle \\pm |11\\rangle), \\\\\n",
    "|\\Psi^{\\pm}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle \\pm |10\\rangle). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The feasibility or security of these protocols depends on the \"quality\" of the available Bell states. However, real sources of entangled qubit pairs or real lossy quantum channels are very likely to produce imperfect Bell states due to preparation errors or imperfect qubit transmission. The aim of entanglement purification is to compensate for this loss in entanglement and restore a maximally entangled Bell state. That is why entanglement purification is also a fundamental component of a quantum repeater [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning we assume a source $S$ of entangled qubit pairs, which generates two-qubit states $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$ with some **state fidelity** $F$ towards the maximally-entangled Bell state $|\\Psi^-\\rangle$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\langle \\Psi^- | \\rho_\\textrm{S} | \\Psi^- \\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, imperfection can be caused by the production process itself or by the transmission of the qubits via lossy quantum channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two parties that each have one of the qubits of the source state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$ are usually called Alice and Bob. The whole scenario is shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig01.png\" width=\"400\" vspace=\"30\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the BBPSSW protocol is that Alice and Bob take two copies of the state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$ and perform certain quantum operations locally on their qubits to finally generate a single two-qubit state with larger fidelity $F' > F$. When this is achieved, the process can be iterated to produce even larger fidelities until a maximally entangled Bell state $| \\Psi^- \\rangle$ is obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section we will explain the BBPSSW protocol step by step and show how Alice and Bob can increase the entanglement of the state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Quantum Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Creation of a Werner State through Random Bilateral Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "From the two-qubit source state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$ the two parties Alice and Bob must first create a so-called **Werner state** $W_F$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_F = F |\\Psi^-\\rangle \\langle \\Psi^-| + \\frac{1-F}{3}\\left(|\\Psi^+\\rangle \\langle \\Psi^+|+|\\Phi^+\\rangle \\langle \\Phi^+|+|\\Phi^-\\rangle \\langle \\Phi^-|\\right).  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a state is diagonal in the Bell basis $\\{ |\\Phi^{+}\\rangle, |\\Phi^{-}\\rangle, |\\Psi^{+}\\rangle, |\\Psi^{-}\\rangle \\}$, has a fidelity of $F$ towards the Bell state $|\\Psi^-\\rangle$, and overlaps equally with the other three Bell states by $(1-F)/3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob can achieve this by applying a so-called **twirl** operation [5] that keeps the $|\\Psi^-\\rangle$ component of the state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$, balances the components of the other three Bell states, and removes all off-diagonal elements. A twirl can be implemented by bilateral operations $B_k (k \\in \\{x, y, z\\})$ that rotate each qubit of the pair by an angle of $\\pi/2$ around the $k$ axis. A random selection from the following set $\\{ U_i \\}$ of 12 combinations of bilateral rotations $B_k$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\{U_i\\}\n",
    "=\n",
    "\\{\n",
    "I, \\\\ B_x B_x, \\\\ B_y B_y, \\\\ B_z B_z, \\\\\n",
    "B_x B_y, \\\\ B_y B_z, \\\\ B_z B_x, \\\\ B_y B_x, \n",
    "\\\\ B_x B_y B_x B_y, \\\\ B_y B_z B_y B_z, \\\\ B_z B_x B_z B_x, \\\\ B_y B_x B_y B_x\n",
    "\\},  \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "transforms the state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$ into the arithmetic average\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_F = \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{i=1}^{12} U_i \\rho_\\textrm{S} U_i^\\dagger,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which will be exactly the desired Werner state $W_F$. Here $I$ denotes the identity operation. An intuitive explanation of the twirl, which comes from molecular physics, can be found in Ref. [2] and is left to the interested reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Alice and Bob randomly select an operation from the set $\\{ U_i \\}$ in a realistic quantum communication scenario, we will also randomly select such an operation in the later implementation in Qiskit. In order to obtain the arithmetic average, we will have to perform several runs of the purification protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarize the quantum operations performed locally by Alice and Bob in a graphical illustration for the sake of clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig02.png\" width=\"1000\" vspace=\"30\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here Alice's and Bob's qubit are referred to as $q_A$ and $q_B$, and $U_{i, A(B)}$ denotes Alice's (Bob's) single-qubit part of the randomly selected operation $U_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Exchange of $|\\Psi^-\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ Components\n",
    "\n",
    "After Alice and Bob have prepared the state $W_F$, one of the parties rotates its qubit by an angle of $\\pi$ around the $y$ axis, which corresponds to using a $Y$ gate,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 & -i \\\\\n",
    "i & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of such a unilateral rotation is that the components of $|\\Psi^-\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ are exchanged in the Werner state $W_F$. Therefore, the operation creates a state $\\rho_F$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_F = F |\\Phi^+\\rangle \\langle \\Phi^+| + \\frac{1-F}{3}\\left(|\\Psi^+\\rangle \\langle \\Psi^+|+|\\Psi^-\\rangle \\langle \\Psi^-|+|\\Phi^-\\rangle \\langle \\Phi^-|\\right), \n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where total phases were omitted in this representation. Without loss of generality, we assume that Alice performs this unilateral rotation, so that the quantum circuit of the protocol up to this point looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig03.png\" width=\"1000\" vspace=\"30\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Application of Bilateral CNOT Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that Alice and Bob can prepare the states $\\rho_F$ from the source states $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$, they will use two copies of $\\rho_F$ to increase the entanglement of one of these copies. In the first step, the two parties must apply a so-called bilateral CNOT gate to the two qubit pairs $\\rho_F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bilateral CNOT gate means that Alice and Bob each apply a CNOT gate to the two qubits they have locally available. The qubit from the first pair serves as the control qubit in the local CNOT operation, while the corresponding qubit from the second pair serves as the target qubit. Remember: In a CNOT gate, the state of the target qubit is flipped if and only if the control qubit is in the state $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now consider all four qubits from the two source qubit pairs $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$, the local quantum circuits of Alice and Bob look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig04.png\" width=\"1000\" vspace=\"30\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have denoted Alice's (Bob's) control qubit $q_{A(B),c}$ and the corresponding target qubit $q_{A(B),t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Measurement of Target Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, Alice and Bob measure the target qubits $q_{A,t}$ and $q_{B,t}$ in the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle \\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig05.png\" width=\"1000\" vspace=\"0\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the measurements, Alice and Bob compare their measurement results. If both measurement results are the same, i.e. the target qubits were projected into state $|00\\rangle$ or $|11\\rangle$, the purification was successful and the control qubits are retained. Otherwise they will be discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see that the purification process is successful exactly in this case, one must calculate the fidelity $F'$ of the resulting state of the control qubits, which we will call $\\rho'_{F'}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F' = \\langle \\Phi^+ | \\rho'_{F'}| \\Phi^+ \\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the state $\\rho'_{F'}$ does not have the same form as $\\rho_{F}$, which is why we chose this notation. We will not elaborate on the calculation of $\\rho'_{F'}$ in this introduction, as it is not required for the implementation in Qiskit, but only provide the result for $F'$[1],\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F' \\equiv F'(F) = \\langle \\Phi^+ | \\rho'_{F'}| \\Phi^+ \\rangle = \\frac{F^2 + \\frac{1}{9}(1-F)^2}{F^2 + \\frac{2}{3}F(1-F) + \\frac{5}{9}(1-F)^2}.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "So, if the input fidelity $F$ of the source state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$ is larger than 1/2, Alice and Bob can distill entanglement from two copies of that state and increase the fidelity of one of those copies. The two parties can then use two qubit pairs whose fidelity has already been increased to create another qubit pair with even higher fidelity, and so on. By iterating the procedure of the BBPSSW protocol described above, the fidelity of a two-qubit state can thus be brought arbitrarily close to 1, which in turn corresponds to a maximally-entangled Bell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Restoration of Werner State\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the state $\\rho'_{F'}$ does not usually have the form of $\\rho_{F}$, i.e. it can contain off-diagonal elements in the Bell basis and the components of $|\\Phi^{-}\\rangle$, $|\\Psi^{+}\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi^{-}\\rangle$ differ in size. But in order to perform a subsequent purification round, we must bring $\\rho'_{F'}$ into the form of $\\rho_{F}$, i.e. we must create something like a state $\\rho_{F'}$,\n",

    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by performing the above steps backwards again. In the state $\\rho'_{F'}$, the components of $|\\Psi^-\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ are first swapped again by a unilateral $Y$ gate (see step 2). Then another twirl operation is performed to create a Werner state $W_{F'}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{F'} = F' |\\Psi^-\\rangle \\langle \\Psi^-| + \\frac{1-F'}{3}\\left(|\\Psi^+\\rangle \\langle \\Psi^+|+|\\Phi^+\\rangle \\langle \\Phi^+|+|\\Phi^-\\rangle \\langle \\Phi^-|\\right).  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This state $W_{F'}$ can now serve as the initial state for a new round of entanglement purification, , since we can easily create the state $\\rho_{F'}$ from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following implementation in Qiskit we will shorten the purification protocol and omit this fifth step. We only want to do a single purification round here and therefore do not convert the output state $\\rho'_{F'}$ of the control qubits back to the Werner form $W_{F'}$ after the target qubits have been measured. Instead, we will directly evaluate the fidelity of the control qubits to the Bell state $| \\Phi^+ \\rangle$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle \\Phi^+ | \\rho'_{F'}| \\Phi^+ \\rangle = F' = \\langle \\Psi^- | W_{F'}| \\Psi^- \\rangle,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "because we know the twirl operation leaves the $|\\Psi^- \\rangle$ component unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herewith we finish the introductory part and turn to the implementation in Qiskit. We will explain in detail how steps 1 - 4 described above can be implemented in Qiskit to determine the state $\\rho'_{F'}$ and calcutate the final $F'$ fidelity."

    "This section describes how to implement the quantum circuit for entanglement purififcation in Qiskit. For a better understanding, we divide the quantum circuit into its individual parts according to the individual steps in **Part I**. This means that we first simulate the source of the entangled qubits to create two qubits in the source state $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$. We then integrate steps 1 (random bilateral rotation) to 3 (bilateral CNOT gate) individually. Step 4 (measurement of target qubits) will then be dealt with separately later, as the implementation is a little trickier here.\n",

    "### 5.1 IBM Q Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already defined the functions `execute_initialization` and `execute_purification` in such a way that we can simply pass the real IBM Q device as the target backend to execute the tomography circuits on it. The reason for this is that the Qiskit function `execute` itself sends a job to a real IBM Q device when this is selected as the backend.\n",

    "When working with real IBM Q devices via the IBM Q Experience, there are two points to consider when performing the entanglement purification experiment as in the previous sections. On the one hand we have to take into account a certain waiting time until the execution of a job and on the other hand we can only send a limited number of jobs to a real device. These two points will be explained in the next two subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1.1 Device Queue, Job Status, and Job Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already mentioned that a real device usually has a queue of pending jobs from other users. This means that, in addition to the actual execution time of a quantum circuit, the user must also wait until all pending jobs in the queue have been executed. A job has run successfully when it could be transmitted to the real device, passed the queue, and the quantum circuit could finally be executed. Only then can we obtain the results using the method `results` and perform all subsequent steps to reconstruct a density matrix.\n",

The errors that come from the part of the circuit that belongs exclusively to the BBPSSW protocol, i.e. gate errors in the circuit `purification_circ` and subsequent measurement errors, are therefore probably underestimated by the noise model used here."

    "## Part VI: Conclusion and Further Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we showed how to use the IBM framework Qiskit and the online platform IBM Q Experience for quantum information processing, using the BBPSSW protocol for entanglement purification as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum circuit for the BBPSSW protocol consists of common single-qubit and two-qubit gates and we have explained in detail how this circuit is constructed in Qiskit. Furthermore, we have demonstrated how to use a library integrated in Qiskit to perform conditional quantum state tomography, which is also required in the BBPSSW protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits in Qiskit can be executed either on a simulator or on real IBM Q devices and we have shown how to use these two backends respectively. When using the simulator, we also explained how simple noise models can be created and integrated into the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) two possible topics that could usefully extend this tutorial. On the one hand, there are possibilities to improve the execution on real devices, and on the other hand, there are other protocols for entanglement purification in addition to the BBPSSW protocol (see e.g. [9] and the references therein).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possibilities that could improve the quality of execution on a real device are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error mitigation through calibration circuits**  \n",
    "The Qiskit element Ignis provides noise mitigation functions through specific calibration routines. The use of these functions could therefore lead to a better performance of the execution on the real device and thus to a more significant increase in the output fidelity $F'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Circuit optimization with internal compiler**  \n",
    "A quantum circuit must be mapped to the physical layout of a real device, i.e. the coupling of the individual qubits with each other and the available set quantum gates is taken into account. This is done via a compiler and the result is a compiled quantum circuit which is actually executed on the real device. The Qiskit compiler knows four optimization levels and you can use this possibility to reduce the length of the compiled circuit, i.e. the number of operations required, and thus suppress the effects of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Circuit optimization with external compiler**  \n",
    "Another possibility is the use of external compilers, such as t|ket⟩™, to optimize quantum circuits. In addition, one could compare the results of different compilers with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, the BBPSSW protocol is one of many for entanglement purification. Some of these protocols work very similarly and differ only in the bilateral two-qubit interaction that Alice and Bob apply locally to their qubits. It is straightforward to implement such a protocol by simply changing the gates that make up the circuit `purification_circ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are also protocols that work with three input pairs $\\rho_\\textrm{S}$, for example, and require a specific measurement outcome of two of these pairs for successful purification. In order to implement such a protocol in Qiskit according to the procedure presented in this tutorial, one would also have to adapt the creation of the ancilla tomography circuits and change the function `purification_shots` so that the conditions for a successful purification are fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another provider has just been released that enables access to the trapped ion device of Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT) [10,11]. If you have AQT credentials, it would be great to see how well the purification protocol works on the trapped ion device. The results could then be compared with earlier experimental results demonstrating entanglement purification for ion qubits [12].\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would like to emphasize that by providing these ideas, we hope to encourage other users to continue learning with this tutorial notebook by trying out the implementation of the ideas."
