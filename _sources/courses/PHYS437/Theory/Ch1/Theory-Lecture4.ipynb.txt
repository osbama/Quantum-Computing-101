    "## Delayed choice quantum eraser\n",
    "\n",
    "A delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, first performed by Yoon-Ho Kim, R. Yu, S. P. Kulik, Y. H. Shih and Marlan O. Scully, and reported in early 1999, is an elaboration on the quantum eraser experiment that incorporates concepts considered in Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment from late 70s to early 80s . The experiment was designed to investigate peculiar consequences of the well-known double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics, as well as the consequences of quantum entanglement.\n",

    " An argon laser generates individual 351.1 nm photons that pass through a double-slit apparatus (vertical black line in the upper left corner of the diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "An individual photon goes through one (or both) of the two slits. In the illustration, the photon paths are color-coded as red or green lines to indicate which slit the photon came through (red indicates slit A, green indicates slit B).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the experiment is like a conventional two-slit experiment. However, after the slits, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is used to prepare an entangled two-photon state. This is done by a nonlinear optical crystal BBO (beta barium borate) that converts the photon (from either slit) into two identical, orthogonally polarized entangled photons with $\\frac{1}{2}$ the frequency of the original photon. The paths followed by these orthogonally polarized photons are caused to diverge by the Glan–Thompson prism.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these 702.2 nm photons, referred to as the \"signal\" photon (look at the red and green lines going upwards from the Glan–Thompson prism) continues to the target detector called $D_0$. During an experiment, detector $D_0$ is scanned along its x axis, its motions controlled by a step motor. A plot of \"signal\" photon counts detected by $D_0$ versus x can be examined to discover whether the cumulative signal forms an interference pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other entangled photon, referred to as the \"idler\" photon (look at the red and green lines going downwards from the Glan–Thompson prism), is deflected by prism PS that sends it along divergent paths depending on whether it came from slit A or slit B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat beyond the path split, the idler photons encounter beam splitters $S_a$, $S_b$, and $S_c$ that each have a 50% chance of allowing the idler photon to pass through and a 50% chance of causing it to be reflected. $M_a$ and $M_b$ are mirrors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam splitters and mirrors direct the idler photons towards detectors labeled $D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$ and $D_4$. Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If an idler photon is recorded at detector $D_3$, it can only have come from slit B.\n",
    "* If an idler photon is recorded at detector $D_4$, it can only have come from slit A.\n",
    "* If an idler photon is detected at detector $D_1$ or $D_2$, it might have come from slit A or slit B.\n",
    "* The optical path length measured from slit to $D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$ and $D_4$ is 2.5 m longer than the optical path length from slit to $D_0$. This means that any information that one can learn from an idler photon must be approximately 8 ns later than what one can learn from its entangled signal photon."

    "## Postulate 4: Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we mathematically model the act of measuring or observing a quantum system considering that the very act of looking at or observing a quantum system irreversibly alters the state of the system? To model this phenomenon, we shall use the notion of a projective or von Neumann measurement (named after Hungarian child prodigy and mathematician, John von Neumann, who was apparently already familiar with calculus at the age of 8). To do so, we must define three classes of linear operators, each of which is increasingly more restricted. All three classes will prove vital throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. *Hermitian operators*: An operator $M \\in \\mathcal L \\left(\\mathbb C^d \\right)$ is Hermitian if $M = M^\\dagger$ . Examples you are already familiar with are the Pauli $X$, $Y$ , and $Z$ gates, which are not only unitary, but also Hermitian. A Hermitian operator has the important property that all of its eigenvalues are real. Thus, Hermitian operators can be thought of as a higher dimensional generalization of the real numbers.\n",
    " 2. *Positive semi-definite operators*: If a Hermitian operator has only non-negative eigenvalues, then it is called positive-semidefinite. Thus, positive semi-definite (or positive for short) matrices generalize the non-negative real numbers.\n",
    " 3. *Orthogonal projection operators*: A Hermitian matrix $\\Pi \\in \\mathcal L \\left(\\mathbb C^d \\right)$ is an orthogonal projection operator (or projector for short) if $\\Pi^2=\\Pi$. This is equivalent to saying $\\Pi$ has only eigenvalues 0 and 1. Let us prove this equivalence briefly: Since $\\Pi$ is Hermitian, we can take its spectral decomposition, $\\Pi = \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\left|\\lambda_i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\lambda_i\\right|$. Hence,\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "   where the last equality follows since {|λi i} is an orthonormal basis. Since the |λi i are orthogonal, we thus have that for all i, λi = λ2i . But this can only hold if λi ∈ {0, 1}, as claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It is important to note that since a projector $\\Pi$’s eigenvalues are all 0 or 1, its spectral decomposition must take the form $\\Pi=\\sum_i \\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi_i\\right|$, where $\\left\\{\\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$ are an orthonormal set. Conversely, summing any set of orthonormal $\\left\\{\\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$ in this fashion yields projector. Observe that a projector $\\Pi$ has rank 1 if and only if $\\Pi=\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|$ for some $\\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle \\in \\mathbb C ^ d $ , since the rank of $\\Pi$ equals the number of non-zero eigenvalues of $\\Pi$, and here $\\Pi=\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi\\right|$ is a spectral decomposition of $\\Pi$. Finally,let us develop an intuition for what a projector actually *does* — for any projector $\\Pi=\\sum_i \\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi_i\\right|$ and state $\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle$ to be measured, we have\n",

    "The exercise above has an important moral — requiring a quantum state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ to be a unit vector (i.e. $\\left|\\alpha\\right|^2 + \\left|\\beta\\right|^2 = 1$) ensures that when measuring $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$, the distribution over the outcomes is a valid probability distribution, i.e. the probabilities for all possible outcomes sum to 1. The other important take-home message here is that measurements in quantum mechanics are inherently probabilistic — in general, the outcomes cannot be perfectly predicted! Finally, we started this lecture by saying that the very act of measuring a quantum state disturbs the system. Let us now formalize this; we will crucially use the fact discussed earlier that a projector projects a vector $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ down into a smaller subspace.

Let us handle each of these in order.\n",

The density operator formalism is more general than the state vector approach we have taken so far, and will be crucial for studying individual subsystems of a larger composite quantum state. Thus, the answer to question 1 is that we have written the output as a matrix simply to slowly ease the transition into the density matrix formalism.\n",

    "A final quirk we should iron out is the following — in terms of measurements, what is the consequence of the fact that a projector $\\Pi_i$ satisfies $\\Pi_i^2 = \\Pi_i$ ? Well, if you observe a quantum system now, and then again five minutes from now, and if the system has not been subjected to any gates or noise in between the measurements, then the two measurement results you obtain should agree (I realize the study of quantum mechanics has likely distorted your view of when you can trust your intuition, but this is one case in which you can). To model this, suppose we measure using $B = \\{\\Pi_i\\}$ and obtain results $i$ and $j$ in measurements 1 and 2, respectively. Then:\n",

    "## Quantum Teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the concepts of the Bell state and measurement in hand, we can discuss our first neat computational trick: Quantum teleportation. Suppose you have a single-qubit quantum state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle= \\alpha\\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\beta\\left|1\\right\\rangle $ in your possession (i.e. as a physical system, not on paper), but that you do not know the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Your friend Alice now phones you and asks to borrow your state. How can you send it to her? One obvious way is simply to pop your system in the mail and physically send it over. However, it turns out that by exploiting the phenomenon of entanglement, you can do something incredible — by sending two classical bits over the telephone to Alice, you can “teleport” $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ instantly to her!\n",
    "\n",
    "To teleport $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$, we assume that you and Alice each share half of a Bell state $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left(\\left|00\\right\\rangle+\\left|11\\right\\rangle\\right)$ to begin with; specifically, you hold qubit 1 of $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle$, and Alice holds qubit 2.

    "Let us break this down piece by piece. The first two wires are held by you; wire 1 holds the state to be teleported, $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$, and wire 2 holds your half of $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle$. The third wire holds Alice’s half of $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle$. Note that we have used $\\left|\\Phi^+_A\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|\\Phi^+_B\\right\\rangle$ to denote the two “halves” of $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle$, but this is poor notation — read literally, this diagram suggests $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle=\\left|\\Phi^+_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\Phi^+_B\\right\\rangle$, which is not true since is $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle$ entangled, and hence from last lecture we know that there do not exist states $\\left|\\Phi^+_A\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|\\Phi^+_B\\right\\rangle$ such that $\\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle=\\left|\\Phi^+_A\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\Phi^+_B\\right\\rangle$ This notation is for illustration purposes only, not to complicate the diagram, and make our analysis easy.\n",

    "The circuit can be divided into 5 steps: Step 1 performs the CNOT, Step 2 the Hadamard gate, Step 3 measures qubits 1 and 2, Step 4 applies a conditional X gate, and Step 5 applies a conditional Z gate. The latter two require clarification: The conditional X gate here takes a classical bit $b$ as input (hence the incoming wire at the top is a double line), and applies X if and only if $b = 1$. The conditional Z gate is defined analogously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have technically parsed this diagram, let us intuitively parse it. First, you begin in Steps 1 and 2 by performing a CNOT and Hadamard on your qubits, followed by a standard basis measurement in Step 3. Since a measurement in the standard basis maps each qubit to either $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ or $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$, the output of your two measurements can jointly be thought of as one of the four bit strings $00$, $01$, $10$, or $11$. Call these bits $b_0 b_1$ . Now you pick up the telephone, call Alice, and tell her the value of $b_0 b_1$ . Conditioned on $b_0 $ , she applies X to her half of the Bell pair, followed by Z conditioned on $b_1$. The claim is that at this point, Alice’s qubit’s state has been magically converted to $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$. In fact, as we shall see shortly, $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ has also disappeared from your possession! In this sense, teleportation has taken place."
