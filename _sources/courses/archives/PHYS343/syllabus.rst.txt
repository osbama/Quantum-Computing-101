Hands-On sessions
*****************

.. role:: red

* :red:`Attendance to all of the hands-on sessions, and submitting the assigned hands-on work is mandatory. Any missed hands-on session, or assigned hands-on work will result in N/A grade. Only officially documented cases (such as medical reports) will be considered for exemption.`
* :red:`In order to be able to attend hands-on sessions,` `the consent form <https://forms.gle/ALcnDcJdTQGByBpK6>`_  :red:`has to be filled beforehand. If you don't fill in and agree on the consent form, please drop this course.`


********************
Theoretical sections
********************

    Attendance to all of the theoretical sessions is not mandatory, however, an attendance above %50 will see a contribution to the final grade up to %10.

*************
Term projects
*************
* **The term project is the final exam.**
* There are two parts: Presentation (~20 minutes), Q&A session after the talk (~10 minutes)
* The presenter will be graded according to the scientific quality of the presentation
* The audience will be graded according to their participation in the Q&A session.
* The term projects will be presented in the last 3-4 weeks
* **Attendance to the term project presentations is mandatory.** The first missed week will result in a reduction of your final grade to %65. The second missed week will result in a reduction of your final grade to %35. If you miss three weeks, you will receive N/A grade.  
* Only one missed week might be allowed with a valid official excuse.
