It turns out that a global phase is insignificant in that it cannot be experimentally detected.

    "### Postulate 3: Composite Quantum Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have considered only single quantum systems, i.e. states $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\in  \\mathbb{C}^d$ for $d\\geq 2$. We need multiple qubits interacting simultaneously for quantum computation. How can we mathematically describe, for example, the joint state of two qubits? The correct Linear Algebraic tool for this task is the tensor product, denoted $\\otimes$. The tensor product allows us to “stitch together” two vectors. For example when two states $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle,\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\\in  \\mathbb{C}^2$ interact, it results in a larger 4-dimensional vector given by $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\\in  \\mathbb{C}^4$ . Formally, we have $\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2=\\mathbb{C}^{2\\times2}$ . In other words, the entries of a vector $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\otimes\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\\in  \\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2$  can be referenced via a pair of indices $(i, j)$ for $i, j \\in {0, 1}$, and the specific rule for doing so is\n",

So for example, $(0, 0)$ is equivalent to index 0, (0, 1) to index 1, and (1, 1) to index 3.

    "Our discussion thus far generalizes straightforwardly to the case of $\\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$ .

Thus, for example, if we add a third qubit to our existing two qubit system, then we have a state which lives in $\\mathbb{C}^{4}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{2}=\\mathbb{C}^{8}$ . In fact, for each qubit we add to our system, the dimension grows by a factor of 2, i.e. it grows  exponentially — in general, an $n$-qubit state will correspond to a vector $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle\\in  \\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$! It is precisely this exponential growth in complexity which makes it difficult for classical computers to simulate the mechanics of an $n$-qubit quantum state — indeed, this was the reason why physicist Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum computer in 1982 to begin with!\n",
