    "## Using the Ising model for embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most adapted models in physics is the Ising model, invented by Wilhelm Lenz as a PhD problem to his student Ernst Ising. The one-dimensional version of it was solved in Ising's thesis in 1924; later, in 1944, Lars Onsager solved the two-dimensional case in the absense of external magnetic field and in a square lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although primarily a physical model, it is quite fair to say that the model became part of the mathematics literature, since its descriptions and formulations involve many interesting tools from graph theory, combinatorics, measure theory, convex analysis and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically, the Ising model can be thought as a system of many little magnets in which case the spins $\\pm 1$ represent a magnetic moment. It can also represent a lattice gas, where the spins now represent whether a site is occupied by a particle or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model defines a universality class, meaning lots of systems simplify to something that looks basically like a magnet. Renormalisation tells us that lots of systems share universal asymptotic dynamics, which is a more formal way of saying they simplify to the same thing. So, anything lying in the Ising model's universality class answers your question. This includes lots of systems that lie on a [network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X10000890) or have some dynamical description emphasising interactions, as well as lots of systems that have a [second-order phase transition](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_second_order_phase_transition#view=5a9cc275c68d6bea42010337) or exhibit some anomalous breaking of a symmetry group under certain conditions. Between these two examples, that's quite a lot of applied mathematics. An interesting meta-commentary on any mathematical model of correlated variables itself being an Ising model can be found in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34175). It also describes non-magnetic physical systems, like string theories and conformal field theories. The point of the model is that, for something so simple, it is incredibly rich -- this is probably why it's stuck about for so long -- and naturally, that makes it difficult to enumerate all the ways in which it has been useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please have a look at [Dalton A R Sakthivadivel's page](https://darsakthi.github.io/posts/2021/02/act-func/) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting embedding approach is then using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Ising model for feature embedding. You start with angle embedding the data, but if the features you are trying to embed have some underlying structure captured by Ising model universality class, then the qubit requirements will be reduced.
