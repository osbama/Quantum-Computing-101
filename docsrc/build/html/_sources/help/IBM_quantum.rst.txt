Invitation e-mail
==============================================

As a part of your course, you'll have education-oriented elevated access right to IBM's quantum computers. 
You will receive an e-mail from `no-reply@quantum-computing.ibm.com`. 

You'll need to `create an IBM account <https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776&target=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.ibm.com%2Foidc%2Fendpoint%2Fdefault%2Fauthorize%3FqsId%3D8d745096-7c02-455c-9b18-5f3bda446ed9%26client_id%3Dv18LoginProdCI>`_ with the e-mail address you have received the invitation from, if you don't have one already.  

Please check your mailboxes, (also spam boxes) before contacting your instructors.

IBM Quantum Lab
####################

You can create a `Jupyter notebook <https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/>`_ (or run one of the hands-on sessions of your coure) in **IBM Quantum Lab** 

In order to run a hands-on session, first download the `.ipynb` file of the session, then upload to the lab.

Once the upload is complete, the notebook will appear on the right hand side. Here, running the hands-on 1 from the Phys343 is shown.
