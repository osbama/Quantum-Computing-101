Term Project Ideas
================================

Hello everyone,

Here are some resources which you can use while looking a topic for your term project.

 * `A link to the list of term projects we suggested last year for CENG798 course. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qkGA7JK1A_9CXJD_BqF_ejUuH2_1ueA6G9BBWhFROw0/edit?usp=sharing>`_
 * `Some undergraduate quantum computing-related projects. <https://www.science.gov/topicpages/q/quantum+computation+project>`_
 * `Qiskit project ideas. <https://medium.com/qiskit/learn-quantum-computing-with-these-seven-projects-7478d90d125a>`_ I also suggest you have a look at Qiskit Medium page. They have useful and interesting content.
 * `A quora question and a nice answer. <https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-Undergraduate-projects-in-Quantum-Computing-and-algorithms>`_
 * `A stackoverflow question and an answer by Scot Aaronson <https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/710/quantum-computing-project-ideas>`_  <3 Really cool guy, you should also check `his blog <https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/>`_, or `research project ideas in his blog <https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=471>`_.
 * `University of Oxford Quantum computing-related projects. <http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/projects/>`_
 * `Ryan O'Donnell's course webpage <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/quantum18/>`_. He has lecture notes and videos. You can have a look at them, and also to HW questions. Maybe you will find something that grabs your attention.
 * `University of Waterloo Lecture Projects.  <https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/teaching/w13/qic823-project.html>`_
 * `MIT project ideas <http://web.mit.edu/8.371/www/project.html>`_.
 * `University of Chicago lecture notes <http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/teaching/spring13.html>`_. They focused on quantum communication, maybe you can find something useful.
 * `Vazirani's project suggestions. <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/s09quantum/notes/projects.html>`_
 * `Project suggestions from Berkeley. <https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs191/fa14/project_suggestions.html>`_


I suggest you to have a look at all these links so that you obtain a broader idea about the kinds of projects you can do. It is quite likely that you will learn a lot of new stuff while working on your term project, so it may as well be something that you find interesting. 

Also, if you find some useful links that you would like to share with your friends, you can e-mail it to me and I will put it here.
