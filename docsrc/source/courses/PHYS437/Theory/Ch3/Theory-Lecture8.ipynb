    "## Functions as oracles\n",
    "The first thing we’ll need to do is understand how to model functions in the quantum circuit model. What makes the task slightly non-trivial is that, recall by Postulate 2 of quantum mechanics, all quantum operations must be unitary and hence reversible. In general, however, given the output $f(x)$ of a function, it is not always possible to *invert* $f$ to obtain the input $x$. In other words, we have to compute $f(x)$ in such a way as to guarantee that the computation can be undone. In the case of binary functions, this is achieved via the following setup:"

    "Here, $U_f  \\in  \\mathcal{U} \\left( \\left( \\mathbb{C}^2\\right)^{ \\otimes 2} \\right)$  is a unitary operator mapping $ \\left|x\\right\\rangle \\left|y\\right\\rangle \\mapsto  \\left|x\\right\\rangle  \\left|x \\oplus y\\right\\rangle  $ for any $x, y  \\in  \\{0, 1\\}$ (i.e. $ \\left|x\\right\\rangle $, $ \\left|y\\right\\rangle $ denote standard basis states), and where $ \\oplus $ denotes XOR or addition modulo 2. Note that by linearity, once we define the action of $U_f$ on standard basis states, we immediately know how it acts on any input state $ \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle   \\in  \\left( \\mathbb{C}^2 \\right)^{ \\otimes 2} $. Observe now that $U_f$ is reversible — this is because running $U_f$ again on its output, $\\left|x\\right\\rangle  \\left|y \\oplus f(x)\\right\\rangle$, yields state $\\left|x\\right\\rangle  \\left|y \\oplus f(x)\\oplus f(x)\\right\\rangle= \\left|x\\right\\rangle  \\left|y\\right\\rangle $, since $f(x) \\oplus f(x)=0$ (adding the same bit twice and dividing by 2 leaves remainder zero). Second, note that we have not specified the inner workings of $U_f$ (i.e. we have not given a circuit implementing the functionality stated above); in this course, we shall treat $U_f$ as a “black box” or “oracle” which we presume we can run, but cannot “look inside” to see its implementation details.\n"

    "## Grover search and approximate counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovered by Lov Grover in 1996, Grover search is more specifically a quantum algorithm for solving the following general problem: Given query access to an oracle containing $N$ items, one of which is “marked”, find the marked item. For example, the “oracle” could be implemented by a 3-SAT formula $\\phi$, indexed by $n$-bit assignments $x$, and the aim is to find a satisfying assignment $x$ (which would be considered “marked”). Grover’s algorithm solves this problem with high probability using $O(\\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database (which turns out to be optimal for a quantum algorithm), whereas a classical algorithm would require $\\Omega(N)$ queries in the worst case. Thus, Grover search solves 3-SAT in $O \\left(\\sqrt{2^n}\\right) $ time."
