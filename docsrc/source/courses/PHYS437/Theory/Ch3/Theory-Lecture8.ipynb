    "The first thing we’ll need to do is understand how to model functions in the quantum circuit model. What makes the task slightly non-trivial is that, recall by Postulate 2 of quantum mechanics, all quantum operations must be unitary and hence reversible. In general, however, given the output $f(x)$ of a function, it is not always possible to *invert* $f$ to obtain the input $x$. In other words, we have to compute $f(x)$ in such a way as to guarantee that the computation can be undone. In the case of binary functions, this is achieved via the following setup:"

    "\n",
    "Discovered by Lov Grover in 1996, Grover search is more specifically a quantum algorithm for solving the following general problem: Given query access to an oracle containing $N$ items, one of which is “marked”, find the marked item. For example, the “oracle” could be implemented by a 3-SAT formula $\\phi$, indexed by $n$-bit assignments $x$, and the aim is to find a satisfying assignment $x$ (which would be considered “marked”). Grover’s algorithm solves this problem with high probability using $O(\\sqrt{N})$ queries to the database (which turns out to be optimal for a quantum algorithm), whereas a classical algorithm would require $\\Omega(N)$ queries in the worst case. Thus, Grover search solves 3-SAT in $O \\left(\\sqrt{2^n}\\right) $ time."

    "## Approximate counting\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined the input to SEARCH as an oracle $U_f$, and the output was to find a marked item $x$, i.e. satisfying $f (x) = 1$. This can be generalized to the much more difficult question: Can we count the number of marked items? Returning to the setting where $U_f$ is a black-box about which we make no assumptions, there are nowadays multiple approaches for quantumly approximately counting $M := |{x \\in \\{0, 1\\} | f (x) = 1}|$ A classic approach is to run quantum phase estimation on the Grover iterate (a theme which reappears in more general quantum walk frameworks, which we will cover later), as it turns out the eigenvalues of the iterate encode $M$ . However, here we shall review a conceptually simpler, more recent approach due to Aaronson and Rall, which does away with the QPE machinery and whittles the solution down to requiring just a single tool — Grover search itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "The basic idea. Let $p = M/N$ , i.e. the fraction of satisfying assignments. Naively, there is a simple classical algorithm for estimating $p$ — simply pick $x$ uniformly at random, and evaluate $f (x)$. By definition, this succeeds with probability $p$, and so $1/p$ trials are expected before a satisfying assignment is found. Of course, in the worst case, $1/p \\in O(N )$, and by now we are spoiled with getting faster $O(  \\sqrt{N} )$ runtimes via Grover search. Thus, roughly, the quantum algorithm we discuss will carefully mimic (a refinement of) the idea above in conjunction with Grover search. In the remainder of this section, we state the algorithm, and sketch its proof of correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantizing the basic idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Grover search, the angle made by start state $ \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle $ with $ \\left|B\\right\\rangle $ is $\\theta = \\arcsin \\left( \\sqrt{ \\frac{|A|}{N}} \\right) $, or in the terminology of this section, $\\theta = \\arcsin(  \\sqrt{M/N }  )$. One can generalize the previous analysis to show that by making $O(r)$ queries to $U_f$ , Grover search finds a marked item with probability $p = \\sin^2(r\\theta)$. The smaller $M$ is, the smaller $\\theta$ is, and hence the larger $r$ needs to be to make $p$ large, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this approach is now that we can forget about the word “quantum”, and simply think of $p$ as a probability arising from some abstract sampling experiment $E$ with parameter $r$ (we henceforth write $E(r)$ where appropriate). The question is: Given the ability to choose $r$ in this experiment $E(r)$, how many runs of $E$ do we need to estimate $p$ (thus allowing us to extract $\\theta$, which encodes the number of solutions $M$ )?\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level outline for achieving this with a quadratic speedup consists of two steps:\n",
    "1. (Rough estimate) Repeat $E(r)$ using exponentially increasing values of $r$ until “sufficiently many” marked items are found. This gives a rough estimate of $K_− \\leq \\theta \\leq K_+$\n",
    "2. (Finetuning the estimate) Iteratively cut down the interval $[K_− , K_+ ]$ to zoom in on $\\theta$.\n",

This is also the cost model we adopt here. We begin by revisiting our old friend, the phase kickback trick.

    "## Approximate counting\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined the input to SEARCH as an oracle $U_f$, and the output was to find a marked item $x$, i.e. satisfying $f (x) = 1$. This can be generalized to the much more difficult question: Can we count the number of marked items? Returning to the setting where $U_f$ is a black-box about which we make no assumptions, there are nowadays multiple approaches for quantumly approximately counting $M := |{x \\in \\{0, 1\\} | f (x) = 1}|$ A classic approach is to run quantum phase estimation on the Grover iterate (a theme which reappears in more general quantum walk frameworks, which we will cover later), as it turns out the eigenvalues of the iterate encode $M$ . However, here we shall review a conceptually simpler, more recent approach due to Aaronson and Rall, which does away with the QPE machinery and whittles the solution down to requiring just a single tool — Grover search itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "The basic idea. Let $p = M/N$ , i.e. the fraction of satisfying assignments. Naively, there is a simple classical algorithm for estimating $p$ — simply pick $x$ uniformly at random, and evaluate $f (x)$. By definition, this succeeds with probability $p$, and so $1/p$ trials are expected before a satisfying assignment is found. Of course, in the worst case, $1/p \\in O(N )$, and by now we are spoiled with getting faster $O(  \\sqrt{N} )$ runtimes via Grover search. Thus, roughly, the quantum algorithm we discuss will carefully mimic (a refinement of) the idea above in conjunction with Grover search. In the remainder of this section, we state the algorithm, and sketch its proof of correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantizing the basic idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Grover search, the angle made by start state $ \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle $ with $ \\left|B\\right\\rangle $ is $\\theta = \\arcsin \\left( \\sqrt{ \\frac{|A|}{N}} \\right) $, or in the terminology of this section, $\\theta = \\arcsin(  \\sqrt{M/N }  )$. One can generalize the previous analysis to show that by making $O(r)$ queries to $U_f$ , Grover search finds a marked item with probability $p = \\sin^2(r\\theta)$. The smaller $M$ is, the smaller $\\theta$ is, and hence the larger $r$ needs to be to make $p$ large, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this approach is now that we can forget about the word “quantum”, and simply think of $p$ as a probability arising from some abstract sampling experiment $E$ with parameter $r$ (we henceforth write $E(r)$ where appropriate). The question is: Given the ability to choose $r$ in this experiment $E(r)$, how many runs of $E$ do we need to estimate $p$ (thus allowing us to extract $\\theta$, which encodes the number of solutions $M$ )?\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level outline for achieving this with a quadratic speedup consists of two steps:\n",
    "1. (Rough estimate) Repeat $E(r)$ using exponentially increasing values of $r$ until “sufficiently many” marked items are found. This gives a rough estimate of $K_− \\leq \\theta \\leq K_+$\n",
    "2. (Finetuning the estimate) Iteratively cut down the interval $[K_− , K_+ ]$ to zoom in on $\\theta$.\n",
