    "## Functions as oracles\n",
    "The first thing we’ll need to do is understand how to model functions in the quantum circuit model. What makes the task slightly non-trivial is that, recall by Postulate 2 of quantum mechanics, all quantum operations must be unitary and hence reversible. In general, however, given the output $f(x)$ of a function, it is not always possible to *invert* $f$ to obtain the input $x$. In other words, we have to compute $f(x)$ in such a way as to guarantee that the computation can be undone. In the case of binary functions, this is achieved via the following setup:"
