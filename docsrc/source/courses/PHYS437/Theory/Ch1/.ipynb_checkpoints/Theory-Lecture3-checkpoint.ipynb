    "The $Z$ gate, on the other hand, has no classical analogue. It acts as\n",

    "Z\\left|0\\right\\rangle=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1  \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} =\\begin{pmatrix}1  \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}=\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\qquad Z\\left|1\\right\\rangle=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}0  \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} =-\\begin{pmatrix}0  \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}=-\\left|1\\right\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Z leaves $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ invariant, but injects a “phase” of −1 in front of $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. This also immediately shows that $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ are eigenvectors of Z with eigenvalues 1 and −1, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z gate is special in that it allows us to inject a relative phase into a quantum state. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z\\left|+\\right\\rangle=Z\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\left|0\\right\\rangle+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left|1\\right\\rangle\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} Z \\left|0\\right\\rangle+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} Z \\left|1\\right\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\left|0\\right\\rangle-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left|1\\right\\rangle=\\left|-\\right\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By relative phase, we mean that only the amplitude on $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ had its sign changed (or more generally, was multiplied by a phase $e^{i\\pi} = −1$). If _all_ the amplitudes in the state were instead multiplied by $e^{i\\pi}$ , then we could simply factor out the eiπ from the entire state — in this case,we would call $e^{i\\pi}$ a global phase. It turns out that a global phase is insignificant in that it cannot be experimentally detected. A relative phase may seemingly also look unimportant - yet, as we shall see in this course, it is one of the features of quantum mechanics which allows quantum computers to outperform classical ones!\n",

    "#### Hadamard Gate\n",

    "Finally, we come to a fourth important unitary gate, the Hadamard gate:\n",

    "H=\n",

    "1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & -1\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard gate is special in that it creates superpositions for us. Namely, we have $H\\left|0\\right\\rangle =\\left|+\\right\\rangle$ and $H\\left|1\\right\\rangle =\\left|-\\right\\rangle$. It can also “erase” superpositions, i.e. $H\\left|+\\right\\rangle =\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $H\\left|-\\right\\rangle =\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ . In other words, $H$ is self-inverse — we have that $H^2 = I$ for $I$ the identity matrix. In fact, the Pauli matrices are also self-inverse."
