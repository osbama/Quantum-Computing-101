    "## Enropy and Entanglement Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "The theme of the last two lectures has been of a quantum information theoretic nature — we have studied cloning (or rather, lack thereof), entanglement, and non-local correlations. Before progressing to our next main theme of quantum algorithms, we now give a brief taste of more advanced ideas in quantum information. In the process, we will continue getting used to working with quantum states in both the state vector and density operator formalisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main questions we ask in this lecture are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can we quantify the “amount” of entanglement in a composite quantum system?\n",
    "* Under what conditions can “less entangled” states be “converted” to “more entangled” states?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question will require the foundational concept of entropy, introduced in the context of classical information theory by Claude Shannon in 1948. The entropy is worthy of a lecture in itself, being an extremely important quantity. The second question above is tied to the discovery of entanglement distillation, in which, similar to the age-old process of distilling potable water from salt water (or more fittingly for our analogy, “pure” water from “dirty” water), one can “distill” pure entanglement from noisy entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most influential scientific contributions of the 20th century was the 1948 paper of Claude Shannon, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”, which single-handed founded the field of information theory. Roughly, the aim of information theory is to study information transmission and compression. For this, Shannon introduced the notion of entropy, which intuitively quantifies “how random” a data source is, or the “average information content” of the source. It turns out that a quantum generalization of entropy will be vital to quantifying entanglement; as such, we begin by defining and motivating the classical Shannon entropy."

    "Let $X$ be a discrete random variable taking values from set $ \\left\\{x_1,\\dots,x_n\\right\\} $, where $ \\text{Pr}\\left(x_i\\right) :=  \\text{Pr}\\left(X=x_i\\right)$ denotes the probability that $X$ takes value $x_i$ . Then, the Shannon entropy $H(X)$ is defined as\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, the logarithm is taken base 2, and we define $0.\\log\\left(0\\right)=0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting our hands dirty understanding $H(x)$, let us step back and motivate it via data compression. Suppose we have a data source whose output we wish to transmit from (say) Germany to Canada. Naturally, we may wish to first _compress_ the data, so that we need to transmit as few bits as possible between the two countries. Furthermore, a compression scheme is useless unless we are later able to _recover_ or _uncompress_ the data in Canada. This raises the natural question: **How few bits can one transmit, so as to ensure recovery of the data on the receiving end?** Remarkably, Shannon’s noiseless coding theorem says that this quantity is given by the entropy! Roughly, the theorem says that in order to reliably transmit N i.i.d. (independently and identically distributed) random variables $X_i$ from a random source $X$, it is necessary and sufficient to instead send $H(X)$ bits of communication.\n",
    "\n",
    " We now explore the sense in which $H(X)$ indeed quantifies the “randomness” or “uncertainty” of $X$ by considering two boundary cases. In the first boundary case, $X$ models a fair coin flip, i.e. $X$ takes value HEADS or TAILS with probability 1/2 each. Then,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we interpret a fair coin as encoding, on average, _one_ bit of information. Alternatively, in the information transmission setting, we would need to transmit a single bit to convey the answer of the coin flip from Germany to Canada. This intuitively makes sense — since the outcome of the coin flip is completely random, there is no way to guess its outcome in Canada with success probability greater than 1/2 (i.e. a random guess)."

    "The entropy formula is odd-looking; to understand how it is derived, the key observation is the intuition behind the coin flip examples, which says that “when an event is _less_ likely to happen, it reveals _more_ information”.

But $I(x)$ also has three other important properties we expect of an “information measure”; here are the first two:\n",

For this, we shall require a quantum generalization of the Shannon entropy $H(X)$, named as  the *von Neumann entropy* $S( \\rho )$, for density operator $ \\rho $.

(For example, matrices in $\\text{Pos}  \\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ have non-negative eigenvalues.) Applying this same interpretation to the set of *density operators* acting on $\\mathbb{C}^d$, $D  \\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ , we thus have that density operators generalize the notion of a *probability distribution*.

    "#### Properties of the von Neumann entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now see how properties of $H(X)$ carry over to $S( \\rho )$. These will prove crucial in our understanding of quantifying entanglement shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *When does a quantum state have no entropy?*\n",
    "   Recall in our biased coin flip example that if an outcome occurs with probability 1 in our distribution, then $H(X) = 0$. Quantumly, the analogue of this statement is that $S( \\rho ) = 0$ if and only if $ \\rho $ is a pure state, i.e. $ \\rho = \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\\!\\left\\langle \\psi \\right| $ for some $ \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle  \\in  \\mathbb{C}^d$ . This is because a recall a pure state is the special case of a mixed state in which one of the states in the preparation procedure is picked with certainty.\n",
    "2. *When does a quantum state have maximum entropy?*\n",
    "   We saw that when $X$ represents a fair coin flip, $H(X) = 1$. This is, in fact, the unique distribution maximizing $H$. Applying this directly to the definition of $S( \\rho )$, we find that $S( \\rho )$ is maximized over all $ \\rho  \\in D \\left( \\mathbb{C}^2\\right)$ if and only if both eigenvalues of $ \\rho $ are 1/2. This implies that $ \\rho  = I/2$. Moreover, this statement generalizes to any dimension $d  \\geq  2$ — for $ \\rho  \\in D \\left( \\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ , $S( \\rho )$ is maximized if and only if $ \\rho  = I/d$.\n",
    "3. *Quantum information is non-negative.*\n",
    "   Since $H(X)  \\geq  0$, it immediately follows by definition that $S( \\rho )  \\geq  0$.\n",
    "4. *What is the quantum analogue of independent probability distributions $X$ and $Y$* ?\n",
    "   Recall that in defining information content, the log function was chosen so as to ensure information is additive when two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independently distributed. The quantum analogue of this has a natural expression: Let $ \\rho, \\sigma  \\in D \\left( \\mathbb{C}^d\\right)  $, be density matrices. Then, $ \\rho $ and $ \\sigma $ are independent if their joint state is $ \\rho  \\otimes  \\sigma $. In the next exercise, you will prove that this indeed preserves our desired additivity property of information for independent quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other important properties of $S( \\rho )$ which we do not wish to focus on at present; for completeness, however, let us briefly mention two more: (1) For arbitrary, possibly entangled, bipartite mixed states $ \\rho_{AB} $:$S \\left(\\rho_{AB}\\right) \\leq S \\left(\\rho_{A}\\right)+S \\left(\\rho_{B}\\right) $ (subadditivity), and (2) $S \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\rho_i\\right) \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i S \\left(\\rho_i\\right)  $ for $ \\left\\{p_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{m} $ (concavity).

    "## Entanglement distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a notion of how to quantify entanglement in pure states, we can become greedy — under what circumstances is it possible to “increase” the amount of entanglement in a composite quantum system? This is a highly non-trivial question, as fundamental communication tasks such as teleportation require highly entangled Bell pairs as a resource. Unfortunately, experimentally producing such pure states is generally a difficult task due to noise from the environment. In other words, in a lab one is typically able to produce _mixed_ states, as opposed to pure states. Moreover, *even if* Alice could produce perfect Bell pairs in a lab on Earth, when she sends half of a Bell pair to Bob on Mars, the transmitted qubit will again typically be subject to noise, yielding a shared mixed state $ \\rho_{AB}$ between Alice and Bob. Do Alice and Bob have any hope of running the teleportation protocol given $ \\rho_{AB}$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC).** To answer the question,it is important to first define the rules of the game. Since Alice and Bob are spatially separated, they are not able to apply joint quantum operations to both systems $A$ and $B$, e.g. they cannot apply a non-factorizable unitary $U_{AB}  \\in  U \\left( \\mathbb{C}^d \\otimes  \\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ to $ \\rho_{AB}$ . However, they _can_ apply local unitaries and measurements, e.g. factorizable unitaries of the form $U_A \\otimes U_B$ for $U_A,UB  \\in  U( \\mathbb{C}^d)$ (i.e.\n",
    "Alice locally applies $U_A$ , Bob locally applies $U_B$ ). They can also pick up the phone and call one another to transmit classical information. Taken together, this set of allowed operations is given a name: Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). The question is thus: *Given a shared mixed state $ \\rho_{AB}$ , can Alice and Bob use LOCC to “purify” or “distill” Bell states out of $ \\rho_{AB}$ ?* The answer is sometimes yes, and protocols accomplishing this are called distillation protocols, as they recover “pure” entanglement from “noisy” or mixed state entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A simple distillation protocol.** We shall discuss a simple distillation protocol, known as the *recurrence protocol*. Given as input a mixed two-qubit state $ \\rho_{AB} \\in D \\left( \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes  \\mathbb{C}^2 \\right) $  our aim is to distill the Bell state known as the *singlet*,   $\\left|\\Psi^-\\right\\rangle =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\left( \\left|01\\right\\rangle - \\left|10\\right\\rangle \\right)$  ; note $I \\otimes Y \\left|\\Psi^-\\right\\rangle =i \\left|\\Phi^+\\right\\rangle $, making it easy to convert one Bell state into the other for the teleportation scheme.

(The formal framework for studying such operations is via *Trace Preserving Completely Positive Maps*, and is beyond the scope of this course.)
